* Modular Design – Encourages reusable and maintainable code.

## Getting Started
1. Installation: Download and install the VG Language compiler or interpreter.
2. Writing Code: Create a new file with the .vg extension and start coding.
3. Running Code: 
   - **Important:** Always run VG programs using a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell), not by directly clicking on the executable.
   - Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
   - Use the command `vg yourfile.vg` to execute your script.
   - This ensures that the packages directory is properly created and libraries can be loaded correctly.

Example:
```vg
print("Hello, World!");  ##Output: Hello, World!
```
