## Important: Running VG Programs
**Always run VG Language programs from a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell), not by directly clicking on the executable file.**

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory using `cd` command
3. Run a VG script:
```sh
vg my_script.vg
```

This executes my_script.vg in the VG Language interpreter. Running from the terminal ensures that the packages directory is properly located and libraries can be loaded correctly.
