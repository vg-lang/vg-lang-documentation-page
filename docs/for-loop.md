# For Loop in VG Language
A for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a block of code. It consists of:

1. Initialization – A variable is initialized before the loop starts.
2. Condition – The loop runs as long as this condition is true.
3. Update – The variable is updated after each iteration.

# Basic Syntax
```vg
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 1) {
    print(i);
}
```
